## Overview

### The app

What I do in this dummy app:

- Create links by NavLink and Link from react-router-dom so the user can switch between pages
- Add a new quote to Firebase Database
- Change the page when user click add new quote button with the programmatic (imperative) navigation 
- List all quotes by fetching data from Firebase 
- When user clicked a quote, switch the page that shows details of quote and change the URL 
- Preventing possibly unwanted route transitions with the "Prompt" component
- Working with query parameters. Change the URL, button label and sort quotes based on button clicks with the useLocation
- Use useRouteMatch to construct nested Route paths dynamically.
- Writing a custom hook to http requests
